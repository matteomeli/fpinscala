Properties for `sum: List[Int] => Int`:

* Sum of an empty list is always 0.
* Sum of a list of n element x of the same value is equal to n*x, e.g. `sum(List.fill(n)(x)) == n*x`.
* The sum of the reversed list should be the same as the sum of the original list.
* The sum of a list should be the same as the sum of the lists resulting from splitting the original list, e.g. `sum(List(a, b, c, d, e)) == sum(List(a, b)) + sum(List(c, d, e))`, since addition is associative.
